This directory contains DifCover output from comparing coverage of RX29_1_F_D08_CTGAGCCA.sort-n.fixmate-m.sort.markdup-r.bam and RX37_2_M_B11_ACTATGCA.sort-n.fixmate-m.sort.markdup-r.bam in /group/millermrgrp2/shannon/projects/dissertation/reanalyzed/sex_marker/SexFindR/step0-mapping/00-alignments_M

SOFTWARE VERSIONS:

FILES:
    Renaming.list == file with the original path to sample1 and sample2 sorted bam files
    ref.length.Vk1s_sorted == sorted lengths of reference genome scaffolds
    *.bedcov.Vk1s_sorted == bed coverage files
    *.unionbedcv == coverage of each bed interval for sample1 and sample2 in corresponding columns
    *.ratio_per_w_CC0_a10_A219_b10_B240_v1000_l500 == ratio of valid bases for sample1 sand sample2 for each window along genome :: calculation ratio=sum_of_cov(sample1)/sum_of_cov(sample2)
    *.log2adj_ == AC*log2(ratio) of above file for each window
    *.DNAcopyout == [chr | loc.start | loc.end | num.mark | seg.mean]; num.mark=# markers in segment; seg.mean=mean copy number ratio of each segment
    *.pdf == plots of whole and plateau copy number ratios between sample1 and sample2; plot one is ordered by locations throughout genome; plot two is ordered by the value of the segment means
    *.DNAcopyout.len == [Contig | contig_length | begin_of_interval|  length_of_interval | ratio]; length of each DNAcopy intervals with corresponding ratios
    *.DNAcopyout.len.hist_b1 == length of each DNA copy interval with corresponding whole contig (DifCover explanation = computed length of each DNAcopy interval and output length of the whole contig to which that interval belongs)
    *.DNAcopyout.up0.7369656 == sample1_coverage > sample2_coverage; DNAcopy intervals with av(adj_coef*log2ratio)> p, where p=enrichment scores threshold (when p=2 will report regions with coverage in sample1 being roughly 4 times larger than coverage in sample2)
    *.DNAcopyout.down0.7369656 == sample2_coverage > sample1_coverage; DNAcopy intervals with av(adj_coef*log2ratio)> p, where p=enrichment scores threshold (when p=2 will report regions with coverage in sample1 being roughly 4 times larger than coverage in sample2)
